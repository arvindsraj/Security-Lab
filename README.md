first setup the mysql database with `CREATE TABLE users (ID MEDIUMINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(60), password VARCHAR(60)) `

next, add some users.  edit the register.php to allow registration, then register some users.

make some users that have passwords that are common, and make admin something unguessable/totally random.

turn back off registration.

then you should be good to go!
